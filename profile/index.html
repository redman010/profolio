        <p>
            My journey to becoming a software developer started from exposure to small software development company called luxury directory. From this exposure I have discovered that I have a number of skills that has helped me transition to the professional I have today. I have always been a quick learner, a stickler for details and have a passion for finding the answers needed. From that point in my life I had dedicated myself to developing my self into the professional I am today not only by self learning, and free resources but also with the guidance of my school Thinkful.<br>
            As a Full stack Developer who was born and raised in New Yorker, I am very accustomed to a fast paced environment. I strongly believe in optimizing efficiency, working hard to accomplish goals and continuously improving myself. Along my journey of life, I have grown an interest in technology, Artwork, finding answers for puzzling conspects, and I love being a creative thinker. As a professional I am a great worker independently or in a group setting. Feel free to contact me anytime and browse my portfolio site projects using the links below.
